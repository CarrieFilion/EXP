  [mdw]
- Additional comment. [mdw]
- More comments; adjusted mstep for final kick. [mdw]
- After a bunch more algorithm checking, I believe that this is now
  implemented as intended.  The major changes are fixing the drifted
  step coefficient interpolation.  The original step.cc implementation
  was correct, just a bit confusing in retrospect since the positions
  have drifted past the velocities so one has to be careful to keep
  track of that in the multstep coefficient interpolation.  In
  particular: the position in the interpolation is "mstep+1" not
  "mstep".  Added a bit more clarification in the comments.   The
  evolution still need to be testing and compared. [mdw]
- Return to the original step strategy but put the coefficient
  interpolation offset into the coefficient interpolation code, rather
  than step.cc. [mdw]
- Clean up the comments only. [mdw]
- Proposed fencepost error fix for multistep algorithm.  Also added some
  additional comments about what's going on in this implementation.
  [Martin D. Weinberg]
- Fixed the weird multistep issue; downward level changes need to be
  limited to the minimum active level or coefficient updates will be
  discarded and only included at the next computation on the target
  particle's new level.  This is broken in both the CUDA and CPU code.
  I doubt it matter much except under usual circumstances, such as very
  large values of multistep. [mdw]

  Weinberg]

- Okay, found the source of the CUDA multilevel implementation at long
  last! [mdw]

  Sigh.  That took a really long time.

  o Embarassingly, it was a typo: the multistep short range needed to be
  [mlevel, mlevel] rather than [mlevel, multistep].  I think I had that
  last range in my head from the coefficient implementation.

  o This deserves a version bump.  And the whole thing needs to be
  tested now.
