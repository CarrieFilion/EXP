src		Source for nbody code


Version reporting:
------------------

EXP automatically stashes its compile time, git branch, and git commit
hash when 'make' is invoked in the src directory.  You can see this
info using the -v flag, i.e. 'mpirun -np 1 exp -v' or 'exp -v'.  Note:
some MPI implementations require the MPI-aware executable to be run
using 'mpirun'.

Compile hints:
--------------

See README.compile for a brief synposis.

If you are using DSMC, download and install the CHIANTI database from https://www.chiantidatabase.org

Add the path to where you install it by adding the following to your .bashrc file:

export CHIANTI_DATA=/path_to_install_location/CHIANTI/dbase

replacing the path_to_install_location as apropriate.

Also set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH by adding the following to your .bashrc file:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

Log out and then back in in order for this to take effect.

For checking/verification:

<same>
make CFLAGS="-DDEBUG" CXXFLAGS="-DDEBUG" 

For debugging:

<same>
make CFLAGS="-g -DDEBUG" CXXFLAGS="-g -DDEBUG" 


For sequence checking:

<same>
make CFLAGS="-DSEQCHECK" CXXFLAGS="-DSEQCHECK" 


For dmalloc checking:

<same>
make CFLAGS="-DUSE_MALLOC" CXXFLAGS="-DUSE_DMALLOC" LDFLAG=


To compile with sequence and dmalloc
