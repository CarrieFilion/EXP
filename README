Compile hints:
--------------

Run: 

libtoolize
aclocal -I m4
autoheader
automake -a
automake
autoconf

And then configure using the following:

./configure --with-vtk-version=6.3 --prefix=/home/someuser --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu LDFLAGS=-lmpi --with-vtk-lib-suffix=6.3

where the --with-vtk* flags are necessary if your distribution uses versioned VTK.  In this example, the VTK version is 6.3.

When configuring alter /home/someuser in the above command to your desired prefix.
Finally run make:

make LDFLAGS="-L." CXXFLAGS="-O3 -DOMPI_SKIP_MPICXX" CFLAGS="-O3" NVCC_EXTRA="-O3" -j16
make install

Download and install the CHIANTI database from https://www.chiantidatabase.org

Add the path to where you install it by adding the following to your .bashrc file:

export CHIANTI_DATA=/path_to_install_location/CHIANTI/dbase

replacing the path_to_install_location as apropriate.

Also set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH by adding the following to your .bashrc file:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

Log out and then back in in order for this to take effect.

For checking/verification:

<same>
make CFLAGS="-DDEBUG" CXXFLAGS="-DDEBUG" 

For debugging:

<same>
make CFLAGS="-g -DDEBUG" CXXFLAGS="-g -DDEBUG" 


For sequence checking:

<same>
make CFLAGS="-DSEQCHECK" CXXFLAGS="-DSEQCHECK" 


For dmalloc checking:

<same>
make CFLAGS="-DUSE_MALLOC" CXXFLAGS="-DUSE_DMALLOC" LDFLAG=


To compile with sequence and dmalloc
