/*! \page multistep Multiple time stepping

<H2>Overview</H2>

EXP uses binary time step tree to increase dynamical througput for
simulations with large dynamic range in characteristic orbital times.
%Time steps for each particle are chosen to be the minimum of 4
standard criteria (see \ref tscrit below) and one criteria that may be
applied by user-defined modules (see \ref modules).

<H2>%Time step criteria</H2>

<ol>

<li> The characteristic drift time scale:
\f$|r_{scale}/|\mathbf{v}|\f$, where \f$r_{scale}\f$ represents an
internal or preset length scale.  This is only used when provided by
an external user routine or in the Particle structure.

<li> The force time scale: \f$|\mathbf{v}|/|\mathbf{a}|\f$ where
\f$\mathbf{a}\f$ is the accelration.

<li> The work time scale: \f$\Psi/|\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{a}|\f$ where
\f$\Psi\f$ is the gravitational potential chosen to be 0 at large
distances from the center of the particle distribution.

<li> The escape time scale:
\f$\sqrt{\Psi/\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{a}}\f$.

</ol>

Each of these are tuned by the prefactors \f$\epsilon_D, \epsilon_V,
\epsilon_A, \epsilon_P\f$ which are the following global variables in
the configuration file: <code> dynfracD, dynfracD, dynfracD,
dynfracD</code>.  These values must be calibrated for a specific
problem at hand, but values of order 0.01 would be typical.  A
particular criterion can be ignored by choosing a large value for the
corresponding \f$\epsilon\f$.

<H2>Expansion bases</H2>

The contribution to the expansion coefficients for all particles on a
particular level are stored separately for the current and previous
step.  Thus, each level maintains a full set of coefficients
corresponding to the contribution of particles at that level.  We call
this the <it>coefficient tableau</it>.  When computing the total
coefficients at particular multistep level, the offset of the velocity
update at the half step allows the coefficient contribution at the
lower inactive levels to be linearly interpolated.  The error in the
contribution from the interpolation is the same order as that for leap
frog itself.

The particle time step is computed after each substep.  If a particle
has changed levels, its previous contribution is substracted from its
former level and its updated contribution is added to its new level.

<H2>Basic algorithm</H2>

<ol>

<li> The global variable #multistep sets the number of time step
levels.  Each successive level has time step \f$t_0/2^l\f$ where
\f$l\f$ is the level counter and \f$t_0\f$ is dtime.  Therfore the
smallest stepping interval is \f$t_0/2^{multistep}\f$.

<li> All bodies start on highest level \f$l=\f$#multistep (smallest
time step) to start on the first step.  After the first step, new
levels are computed and the multistep coefficient tableau is updated.

<li> At each substep, particle time steps are recomputed.  Particles
that change levels are flagged.  At the end of the step, a particle
update tableau is computed on each node and sum reduced over all
nodes.

</ol>

<H2>External time step variable</H2>

The Particle structure has two time step specific variables
<code>dtreq</code>, the user-specified time step, and
<code>scale</code>, the intrinsic scale for the particle.  If these
values are less then zero, the user-requested time step criterion or
the characteristic drift time scale, respectively, are ignored.  These
values are set to -1 by default (ignored).
