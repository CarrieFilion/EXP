<p> I wrote the EXP code over about 18 years, incorporating published
biorthogonal expansions and my own published and unpublished work on
n-body methodology.  This version has been rewritten to exploit the
similarity in overall structure of all biorthogonal expansions and
C++ object-oriented style.
</p>

<p>
The project has two primary goals: 
<ul>
<li> To develop a state-of-the-art research tool for my own research
and the research of my group and outside collaborators
<li> To continue to advance the methodology to allow more complex
galactic interactions to be studied
</ul>
</p>

<p> The current version is ANSI C++ compliant (or nearly so and uses
c++-11 features) and includes dynamic loading of user libraries with a
standard interface, allowing independent development and testing of
force routines, component interactions, etc. without recompiling or
affecting the main code (see: \ref modules).  The source is maintained
with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> to facilitate
collaborative development and hosted by <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/mdweinberg/exp">Bitbucket</a>.</p>

<p> Recent enhancments include a GPU implementation for adaptive basis
force evaluation and ongoing development of %Direct %Simulation Monte
Carlo gas dynamics. </p>

Research making use of and feeding back into this project has been
supported in part by the NASA ATP, NSF Astronomy, and the University
of Massachusetts/Amherst.  I thank the Simons Foundation/CCA for
providing access to a state-of-the-art GPU cluster, where the CUDA
suport for adaptive force bases is being tested.
