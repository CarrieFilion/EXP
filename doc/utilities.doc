/*! \page utilities Phase-space file utilities

The binary output format, <code>psp</code> is a generalized
hierarchical self-describing format designed to keep most of the
information about all components in a phase space that the code can be
restarted from the dump file.

The following three utilities manipulate the phase-space files:

\par pspinfo OUT

Lists all of the dumps in a <code>psp</code> file (here name OUT) and
their attributes.

\par pspstat OUT

Prints summary statistics (number of bodies, center of mass, center of
velocity angular momentum, KE, PE, mass, etc.) for the PSP dump


\par psp2tipsy [-t TIME] OUT

Converts dump in file OUT at TIME to a tipsy format.  Data is written
to stdout.  The tipsy components (dark, star, gas) are determined from
the first word in the name field of each component.

\par pspsplit [-t TIME] OUT

Split out the dump at TIME from OUT. Data is written to stdout. Useful
for restarting from a particular time point.

\par psp2ascii [-t TIME] OUT

Converts dump in file OUT at TIME to ascii files, one for each component.
The format is the same for ascii initial conditions.

\par psp2ta [-t TIME] OUT

Write an array of a particular PSP double or integer attribute in particle order, primarily for use with Tipsy.

\par psp2histo [-t TIME] OUT

Make a histogram of position, velocity, or a articular PSP array attribute.

\par psp2histoE [-t TIME] OUT

Make a histogram of electron distribution properties (for use with DSMC)
