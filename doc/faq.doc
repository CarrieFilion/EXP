\par Q1. The code dies repetitively at the same time step while trying to write phase-space output.  What is wrong?

	Older distributions of GNU/Linux have a 2<sup>31</sup> file-size
	limit.  Newer versions (e.g. on the buzzard cluster) do not
	have this limitation.  Either periodically rename your output file 
	or use the "outpsn" (see OutPSN) method, which writes each %dump 
	to its own file.  

	However, the standard production version of GNU C++ (v. 3.3)
	has an iostream bug that also limits C++ streams to the same
	2<sup>31</sup> file-size. This has been fixed by the gcc folks
	and this problem will disappear in GNU C++ v 3.4.

\par Q2. My loadable modules don't load.  What is wrong?

	The global variable <code>ldlibdir</code> defines the
	location of all the loadable libraries.  Make sure that
	you include this in your input file, e.g. a line like:

	<code> ldlibdir : /home/weinberg/lib/user </code>

	The default value for <code>ldlibdir</code> is the current
	directory, so if you want to test a particular module, you
	can put it in your run directory without specifying a library
	location.
