/*! \page adaptive Adaptive bases

The EXP uses two production varieties of adaptive bases:
<ol>

<li> A spherical Sturm-Liouville (SL) basis conditioned on an input
spherial profile: Sphere

<li> A cylindrical SL basis conditioned on an input disk profile using
an empirical function method: Cylinder

</ol>

Each of these bases are constructed when instantiated from scratch or
from a cache file written by a previous invocation.  The spherical SL
basis is quick to construct, so caching is overkill.  The construction
of the Cylinder case can take hours of wall clock time, so reusing the
basis is often desired.  As described in \ref config, each Component
has a short config file which specifies the PotAccel class, the
component parameters, the file containing the phase space and PotAccel
parameters.  In particular for the Cylinder class, the parameter which
specifies the cache file is <code>eof_file=.eof.cache.file</code>
where <code>.eof.cache.file</code> is the name of the cache file for
this case.  The cache file is read and compared with the desired
Cylinder class parameters, if they match, the cache file is used,
otherwise, the basis is recomputed from scratch.

The fields for the intrinsically two-dimensional cylindrical basis
functions can take many hours to compute on a single node/laptop.
