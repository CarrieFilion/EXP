A more complex example of a disk and halo simulation using higher resolution
adaptive bases.  The cylindrical tables will take much longer to compute.

The EJ* parameters in halo.conf and disk.conf instruct the Component
class to adjust the expansion center to follow the gravitational
potential minumum.  Use the web page documentation for additional
details on these parameters.

Run as follows.  First, change the ldlibdir parameter to point at your
library install directory.  Then, execute the command:

mpirun -np 6 exp -f IN.FILE

assuming that you have a machine with 6 cores.
