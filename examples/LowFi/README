A trivial example of a disk and halo simulation using low-fidelity
adaptive bases.  This will test your build and provide a starting
point of exploring parameters.  The configuration in the ../Better
directory will build a higher resolution, more accurate basis.

Run as follows.  First, change the ldlibdir parameter to point at your
library install directory.  Then, execute the command:

mpirun -np 6 exp -f IN.FILE

assuming that you have a machine with 6 cores.
