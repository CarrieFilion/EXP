The generated Makefile depends on the LAM MPI library
whose location should be specified in your environment,
e.g.:

	setenv LAMHOME /usr/local/lam
or

	LAMHOME=/usr/local/lam


You will also need to add $LAMHOME/bin to your path, so
that the mpi compilers wrappers hcc & hf77 are available, 
e.g.:

	setenv PATH ${LAMHOME}/bin:${PATH}

To compile everything you will need to issue the
following commands:

aclocal
autoconf
automake
./configure <options>
make

Alternatively, one can use the autogen.sh script
which does everything:

./autogen.sh <configure options>

The configure options are found using: ./configure --help
You can change the default compilers as follows:

csh (tcsh):

		env CC=egcc CXX=g++ ./configure

	or

		setenv CC egcc
		setenv CXX g++
		./configure

sh (bash):

		CC=egcc CXX=g++ ./configure
