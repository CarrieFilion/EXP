/*! \page config Configuration files
The main configuration file identified on the <code>exp</code> command
line using the <code>-f</code> flag. The default parameter file, in
absence of a <code>-f file</code> override, is named
<code>PARAM.FILE</code>.

The parameter file is divided into stanzas.  Each stanza (except the
<em>global</em> stanza) begins with a tag of the form
<code>[stanza_name]</code>.  Each stanza is followed by lines which
contain Key and Value pairs demarcated by a ':'.  All
<code>Key:Value</code> pairs before the first stanza tag are
considered global.  A line may be commented with a leading '#'.

The currently defined stanzas are:

\par [components]
     
     Each Key is the mnemonic for a component and each Value is the
     name of file in the working directory which defines the
     component. The mnemonic may contain spaces.  In particular, to
     easy the transition between the phase-space format used in this
     code (\ref bodies) and Tipsy, we use the convention that the
     first space delimited part of the mnemonic is used by the
     <code>psp2tipsy</code> (\ref utilities) to determine the type
     of tipsy particle.

\par [output]

     Each Key defines the type of Output that the code will generate.
     The alue is the space delimited list of parameters for the
     Output routine.  You can have as many instances of these as you
     like (there might be occasion reasons to have duplicates).  The
     Key is the class name in lower case.

\par [external]

     These define External force routines.  Syntax is as for %Output
     above: the Key is the name of the type and the value is the space
     delimited parameter list.  The Key is the class name in lower
     case.

\par [interaction]

     Key and Value pairs here define the interactions between
     components.  Think: Key feels Value to get the sense of the
     interaction.  Unfortunately, this means a fully consistent
     simulation requires all pairs of components to be listed.

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
nbodmax : 10000
nthrds : 2
dtime : 0.05
ldlibdir : /home/weinberg/ExpMPI/lib/user
nsteps: 100

[components]
dark halo : halo.conf
star disk : disk.conf

[output]
outlog : nint=10
outps : nint=5
orbtrace : norb = 5
# outdiag : nint=3

[external]
# usertest : parm=3
userbar : length=1.0 comname=sphereSL
# usersat : comname=bessel

[interaction]
dark halo : star disk
star disk : dark halo
</pre>

<h2>%Component configuration</h2>

Each component file should contain four fields deliminated by ':'
characters.  The first is the Force name, the second is the list of
parameters that that will be passed to Component.  The third is the
name of the bodies file (in ascii) and the fourth is the list of
parameters that will be passed to the Force.

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
sphereSL : none : halo.bod : rmax=27.5
</pre>

Note that new lines are not significant for the component
configuration file so the following is equivalent to the example
above:

<pre>
sphereSL
:
none
:
halo.bod
:
rmax=27.5
</pre>
