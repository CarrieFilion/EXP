/*! \page utilities Phase-space file utilities

The binary output format, <code>psp</code> is a generalized
hierarchical self-describing format designed to keep most of the
information about all components in a phase space that the code can be
restarted from the dump file.

The following three utilities manipulate the phase-space files:
integer values:

\par pspinfo OUT

Lists all of the dumps in a <code>psp</code> file (here name OUT) and
their attributes.

\par psp2tipsy [-t TIME] OUT

Converts dump in file OUT at TIME to a tipsy format.  Data is written
to stdout.  The tipsy components (dark, star, gas) are determined from
the first word in the name field of each component.

\par pspsplit [-t TIME] OUT

Split out the dump at TIME from OUT. Data is written to stdout. Useful
for restarting from a particular time point.

\par psp2ascii [-t TIME] OUT

Converts dump in file OUT at TIME to ascii files, one for each component.
The format is the same for ascii initial conditions.
