\par Q1. The code dies repetitively at the same time step while trying to write phase-space output.  What is wrong?

	Older distributions of GNU/Linux have a 2<sup>31</sup> file-size
	limit.  Newer versions (e.g. on the buzzard cluster) do not
	have this limitation.  Either periodically rename your output file 
	or use the "outpsn" (see OutPSN) method, which writes each %dump 
	to its own file.  You will be limited to about 40 million particles
	without additional magic.
