<p> I wrote the EXP code over about 15 years, incorporating published
biorthogonal expansions and my own published and unpublished work on
n-body methodology.  This version has been rewritten to exploit the
similarity in overall structure of all biorthogonal expansions and
C++ object-oriented style.
</p>

<p>
The project has two primary goals: 
<ul>
<li> To develop a state-of-the-art research tool for my own research
and the research of my group and outside collaborators
<li> To continue to advance the methodology to allow more complex
galactic interactions to be studied
</ul>
</p>

<p> The current version is ANSI C++ compliant (or nearly so) and
includes dynamic loading of user libraries with a standard interface,
allowing independent development and testing of force routines,
component interactions, etc. without recompiling or affecting the main
code (see: \ref modules).  The source is maintained with SUBVERSION <A
HREF="http://subversion.tigris.org">(SVN)</A> to facilitate
collaborative development.  </p>

<p>
Note: this code is <em>NOT</em> in the public domain.  You need permission
from the author to use it.
