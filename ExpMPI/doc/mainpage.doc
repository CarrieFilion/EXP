/*! \mainpage EXP

<body>

<p> I wrote the EXP code over about 10 years, incorporating published
biorthogonal expansions and my own published and unpublished work on
n-body methodology.  This version has been rewritten to exploit the
similarity in overall structure of all biorthogonal expansions and
C++ object-oriented style.
</p>

<p>
The project has two primary goals: 
<ul>
<li> To develop a state-of-the-art research tool for my own research
and the research of my group
<li> To continue to advance the methodology to allow more complex
galactic interactions to be studied
</ul>
