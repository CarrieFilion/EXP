-- Exercise this interface like crazy to find all of the bugs and make
   a hit list of enhancements.  In particular, are there missing
   member functions in the pyEXP interface needed for critical tasks?

-- Add additional workflow examples to the examples directory.  The
   existing ones need more work.

-- Continue to check MPI.  At this point, parallel computation of the
   coefficients appears to be working.

-- We can remove simpleSL from utils/Analysis at some point.
