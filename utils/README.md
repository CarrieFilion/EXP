# EXP utilities

These are helper routines for the EXP package, mostly providing
standalone analysis routines outside of the Python pyEXP framework for
testing and examining basis functions and analyzing phase-space
snapshots.

### Analysis

Routines analyze and help visualize phase-space and coefficient data

### ICs

Routines to generate initial conditions for disks and halos for used
to create example phase-space for EXP.

### MSSA

Some experimental MSSA based analysis code.  The main MSSA code is
in the pyEXP package.

### Phase space

Standalone routines for summarize phase-space properties using the EXP
phase-space output files.

### SL

Routines that can create and demonstrate the features of the adaptive
Sturm-Liouvile and empirical-orthogonal-function basis functions.

### Test

Two routines that test internal EXP technology

### Cooling

[These are not the droids you are looking for!]

Check heating and cooling rates from DSMC species files. The DSMC
module is not distributed in the public release.
