/*
	QADAPT - a recursive adaptive quadrature program,
		callable from C.

	Calling syntax:

		qadapt(a, b, func, tolerance)

	Arguments: 

		double a  --- lower limit of integration
		double b  --- upper limit of integration
		double (*func)() --- pointer to function you want to 
				integrate
		double tolerance --- error tolerance


	Returns: 
		double 






	QADAPT is an adaptive quadrature routine based upon the
	midpoint rule. The heart of the algorithm is the 
	function quadsplit(), which takes an interval and divides
	it into three parts, and then uses the midpoint rule to estimate 
	the integral over the whole interval and over each subinterval.
	If these two estimates differ significantly, quadsplit() is called
	for each subinterval in turn.

	If the number of subdivisions becomes excessively large
	(currently the maximum is about 25 -- a dynamic range of 10^12),
	qadapt() will flash a warning signal and then return its
	most recent guess at the integral.
	If this occurs, first make sure the interval is supposed
	to converge at all! If your integral is convergent
	then you may be able to fix the trouble by either (1) relaxing
	your error tolerance or (2) subdividing the interval ``by hand''
	and calling qadapt() on each piece.

	Remember that if your function has a particularly narrow spike
	in an arbitrary place, qadapt() might not find it on the
	first iterations and hence might think it has converged.
	If you are faced with a function having spikes at places
	unknown to you, be sure to call qadapt() on intervals small
	enough to give it a chance to detect the spikes.
