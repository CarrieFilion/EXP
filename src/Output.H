//! Output routines.
/*! These are designed to be run in a chain at each step.  Each Output
  class is responsible for determining when to run.  Initialization
  parameters are parsed on construction and available to the
  contructor for initializing control variables.

  The class is also responsible for cycling through the component list
  and operating on each phase space accordingly.  NB: the alternative
  would be to allow each component to define an output method.  However,
  this can easily result in a chaos of specialized output streams and so
  I rejected this approach.

  The stopWatch Timer is implemented in the base class but can be used
  by any derived class to time the output event.  See OutPS for an
  example.
