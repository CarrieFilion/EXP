If you are using DSMC, download and install the CHIANTI database from https://www.chiantidatabase.org

Add the path to where you install it by adding the following to your .bashrc file:

export CHIANTI_DATA=/path_to_install_location/CHIANTI/dbase

replacing the path_to_install_location as apropriate.

Also set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH by adding the following to your .bashrc file:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

Log out and then back in in order for this to take effect.
