o TraceAccum method is now default for Trace algorithm implementation.

o The unstable energy conservation algorithm remains in the Weighted
  and Hybrid method.  Perhaps this should be propagated the same way?
  Or perhaps the energy conservation method works for Hybrid and not
  Trace.  Check this?

o More generally, all algorithms (Direct, Weighted, Hybrid and Trace)
  would have regression tests ideally.

o Implement Fokker-Planck-Landau collsiions for all methods in
  addition to Trace
